## Computer skills that you require to be a very good consultant
### I'll also share the link to the resources (99%) of them are free, so whenever you get time, have a go.

#### Microsoft Excel
* The best resource you can possibly get for free to learn MS Excel is the YouTube Channel [ExcelIsFun](https://www.youtube.com/@excelisfun)
* For advanced data analysis and visualisation, you can check out EdX courses. While I do not know how good they are (never took an excel course on EDX) but a lot of the people on the community
talk about it being good. So do check it out over [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-data-analysis-using-excel-2) and [here](https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-excel-2)
* I don't necessarily think that you should need VBAs as far as health consulting is concerned, but I am nevertheless giving you a link just in case you are covered. 
Hop on to [this](https://openeducation.blackboard.com/mooc-catalog/courseDetails/view?course_id=_219_1) link and you are in good stead!

#### Power BI
Now I don't need to beat a dead horse, but you'll find plenty resources about PowerBI as it is the new shiny toy in the analytics community so I'll just go with the guys whose videos
I watched.
* So this [guy](http://youtube.com/c/guyinacube) has a pretty exhaustive list which will definitely serve as the first initial push as you venture into this new field.
* And for the only paid resource in this markdown file but I do very much recommend that you especially do this (only 400 rs.) this PowerBI course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/) 
by Maven analytics which will help you be so prepared that you can even jump ship to Business intelligence should you wish to delve deeper in to the corporate world.


##### Caveat and an extra point.
* I have not listed any tableau source as you can see, but lets just get these things right and then tackle tableau. Tableau is an a high level tool and you may not have the need to use it at all.
So it wouldn't be wise to waste your time over then when you can just be watching documentaries in that time haha!.
* Additionally, to completely nail PowerBI you need to know *some* level of statistics. While I'll try to give a streamlined path by maybe teaching it to you while I am there 
(given you're okay with it) it is important you practice from time to time.
Doing math is like going to the gym, if you completely stop after a while, you'll lose your gains (Guilty :( ). 

With that said, Good luck with this Viyo! I am sure you'll be amazing at this too. Your aptitude and your never say never (except maybe when it comes to rational consumerism) is the reason
why you're the bestest.
